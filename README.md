# CVProject2020
A repo to host the computer vision project

to launch the execution you only need to launch the script found in each folder. 

The script can handle few image (few image were given for the project) but it can be modified handle more. 

Given note that the second script need one or more sample to compute the mean and standard deviation. Given that there were only two image  I used a piece of one the target image as a sample, but this is not a good practice
